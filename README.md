# florida-mui

So I got this working with the latest version at this point.

Once the real release happens with a real NPM release version
I can lock it down; but for now we have to note it this way...

[here is the commit time stamp](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/commit/bc80a575710ddda00c1f2aadbc717b927870002a)

I ported this over from
[this working version](https://github.com/stormasm/react-router-mui)
I had gotten working while I was in Florida...

Until the 1.0 release happens this code will be referenced with
the tag **florida**.
